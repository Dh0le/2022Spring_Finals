### Research questions
- HYPOTHESIS 1

The theft type crime is more likely to occurs in the neighborhood that has higher price in real estate.

- HYPOTHESIS 2

Vehicle collisions are more frequent in areas with lower real estate prices. 

- HYPOTHESIS 3

Neighborhoods with lower housing prices are more likely to experience serious vehicle collision.(Vehicle collisions with fatalities are defined as serious collisions.)

- HYPOTHESIS 4

The increase of crime and vehicle collision affects the real estate price negatively.
The decrease in vehicle collision and crime will positive affect the real estate price.


### Conclusions
#### HYPOTHESIS 1: 
![img_8.png](img_8.png)

- Reject the hypothesis: Theft-type crime has nothing todo with the estate price in neighborhood.

- Special finding: theft-type crime is more likely to occur in remote areas.

#### HYPOTHESIS 2: 
![img_9.png](img_9.png)

- Reject the hypothesis:There is no relationship between Vehicle collisions and real estate prices.

- Special finding:the num of collisions from different collision types has a significant correlation with each other.

#### HYPOTHESIS 3:
